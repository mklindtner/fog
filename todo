Current:
    validators (so no exceptions)
    Tests (focus on making more or?) (THIS)
    SETUP REMOTE intellij
    CRAWLERS

    --- ALL functionality done, Sprint done ---
    --backLog--
    SQL
        rollback(transactions) for index order (so no customer becomes created w/o order)
            consider moving this logic into an dao method
            two parameters now: orderLine and order for createOrder
    ListOfCustomer
        show list of customers if wrong
    Should make password empty
    ErrorHandler should be logging all exceptions


    ---Found mistakes---
    move order/orderLine down til DATA and use transaction
    ensure logger doesn't overwrite file
    get proper stackTrace in exception
    redirect to the error page in case of exception(?)
    employee unable to accept, decline or create orders for customers
    Material responsible cannot create new materials and add them to the formula
    Transaction not created for create order and orderLine
    Test for all classes
        Test exceptions for all classes
        Catch uncoverable exceptions in facade
        Test more "complicated classes" --> like order (like i did)

    -- 2nd priorty--
    improve svg stykliste
        create skur
        fix current picture
     createUser
        confirm password
    Helper jsp footer & implement to employee (pagination)
    Create exceptionHandler so I can stop runtime at logic layer


    --3rd Priority--
    Employee Homepage
        -see rejected offers (able to throw them out too)
    Index
        Send thank you for the order notifcation
    MysqlConnector
        Find out why I can't find my own created environment variable
            when solved: set developmentState depending on local or remote environemnt
    Stykliste
        create stklist w. shed
    Errorpage
        redirect etc.


    --Thomas funktionaitet--
    Glemt password
        send email
    Confirm password
    B-crypt password




    --MistakesToFix--
    Exception when after creating customer and goes to customerList


JUnit:
Create test for customer login
Create test for reg_date for customer/employee
    -remove the milliseconds in mysql
Create test for id for customer/employee
    -mby create method in dao
Create test for Facades(is that REALLY neccessary?)
