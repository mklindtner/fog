BillOfMaterials
    linje 610 - doesn't check for loop, how can i in test?

JUnit:
Create test for customer login
Create test for reg_date for customer/employee
    -remove the milliseconds in mysql
Create test for id for customer/employee
    -mby create method in dao
Create test for Facades(is that REALLY neccessary?)
Refactor so that service instantiates tabels and drops them later
OrderDAOTEST
